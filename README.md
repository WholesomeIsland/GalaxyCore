Galaxy Network is a network solution designed primarily for use in game engines such as Unity, Unigine, Stride (Xenko). However, it is possible to use in any other environments supporting the c'net Standart 2.0.
The solution consists of a client and server part, both presented as a set of libraries connected to the project. The Galaxy network is capable of operating both in an authoritarian mode and in relay mode. Below is a set of currently supported functionality.

Instructions for installing https://youtu.be/eo6nW2DM0TE

Network: Authorization/registration. Accounting for network connections. Automatic work with NAT. Automatic connection recovery. Support for traffic encryption. Protection from packet spoofing. Support messages with and without delivery guarantee, with sorting, with order. Support for an automatic drop of out-of-date messages. Routing (server, client, instances, essence).

Instances (rooms, worlds, locations): Creation. Getting a list. Instances manager. Entrance/exit. Sending a message to all customers of the instances. Customer management support. Automatic and manual host transmission for non-authoritarian or partially authoritarian logic. Full support for authoritarian logic. Physics support. Support network frames from (1 to 120 network phps). The ability to set a password to the login. The ability to create invisible instances. Support huge locations with network visibility.

Physics: support for primitive colliders. Support for the Terrain Collider. a toolkit for baking stage colliders for the server. ray cast with tag and dynamic features support. Support for line and angular acceleration.

Network entities: Create/delete. Support for server physics. Customer management support. The ability to transfer an object to another player, or transfer to an authoritarian model. The ability to balance objects between customers. Support for Authoritarian Server Management. The ability to directly exchange messages between instances of the entity. The function of creating and deleting an entity (z go). Built-in position and orientation synchronization functionality in space.

Other features: Built-in protobuf support. Built-in Bit serializer.

Supported backend: Support mono. Support il2cpp. Meets net standart 2.0 specifications. Support ecS, Jobs, Dots. Possible use outside of Unity. Support for Stride (Xenko). Unigine engine support.

Server-supported platforms: Windows. Linux. Macos.

Supported and tested platforms (for the customer): Windows. Linux. MaxOS. Android. Ios. In theory, other platforms should be supported, with the exception of WebGL.

In alpha: Synchronizing the parameters of the animator. Server Search for a Path

Total:

The solution is distributed as an open source template and a set of closed libraries. There is no direct dependence on the type of database, you can use any .net supported
